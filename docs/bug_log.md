# Bug log

One entry per bug, in the order found. Each entry must be readable by someone
who has not seen the waveform:

- **Symptom** — what failed, and what the failing output actually said.
- **Localization** — how the search was narrowed. This is the part that matters.
- **Root cause** — stated in protocol or microarchitecture terms, not "typo on
  line 88". A typo is how the bug got in, not what the bug was.
- **Fix** — what changed and why that is the right place to change it.
- **Test that catches it now** — by name. A bug without a regression test is
  still open.

A bug found by inspection rather than by a failing test still gets an entry, and
the "test that catches it now" field still has to be filled in.

## B1. Four unit tests silently mis-timed their own stimulus (Phase 1, testbench)

**Symptom.** Four of five Phase 1 unit tests failed on first run, each in a way
that looked like a different RTL bug:

```
credit_counter  cycle 3: rtl=3 model=4 (send=0 ret=1)
fifo            out of order: [160, 160, 161, 162]
skid_buffer     assert [0, 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, ...] == [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]
```

A duplicated FIFO head, a skid buffer apparently dropping beat 2 and
duplicating beat 3, and a credit counter off by one. Three different modules,
three different-looking failures.

**Localization.** The common factor was that all three failing tests drove an
input and then immediately awaited a clock edge, while the one passing
randomized test (`rr_arbiter`) did not depend on exactly which edge its
stimulus landed on. That pointed at the testbench's timing model rather than at
three unrelated RTL bugs, so rather than guess, a throwaway probe measured the
behaviour directly against `credit_counter`, whose state is a single integer:

```
after reset:                                credits=4
drove send=1, awaited ONE edge:             credits=4     <-- not sampled yet
awaited a SECOND edge (send still 1):       credits=3     <-- sampled here
```

**Root cause.** In cocotb 2.x a value written with `sig.value = x` is applied
*after* the next awaited edge, so the DUT does not sample it at that edge but at
the following one. Every test written as `drive(); await RisingEdge()` therefore
applied its stimulus one cycle later than it accounted for. In `credit_counter`
the stimulus stayed asserted across two edges and was counted twice; in `fifo`
the `rd_ready_i` that was supposed to pop the head did not take effect until a
cycle later, so the head was sampled twice; in `skid_buffer` the same skew made
the testbench's notion of which beats fired disagree with the DUT's.

This was a testbench defect, not an RTL defect. Worth logging anyway, because
it is the failure mode that most easily produces a false RTL bug report: three
modules all looked broken, and the instinct to start editing the RTL would have
introduced real bugs into correct code.

**Fix.** Added `tbutil.step()`, which advances one edge and then offsets a
nanosecond past it, giving ordinary cycle semantics: after `step()`, registered
outputs are settled and any value driven is sampled at the next edge. Every
test was converted to `sample-then-drive` around `step()`. A second, related
defect was fixed at the same time: `test_random_backpressure_preserves_order`
read back `dut.dn_ready_i`, a signal the testbench itself drives, and got the
stale value. Testbenches now use the local Python variable instead of reading
back their own outputs.

**Test that catches it now.** All five Phase 1 unit tests, which fail
immediately if `step()` is reverted to a bare `RisingEdge`. `step()` is the
single point where the idiom is defined, so the whole suite regresses together
rather than one test at a time.

## B2. A unit test asserted the opposite of its module's contract (Phase 1, testbench)

**Symptom.** `test_simultaneous_read_write_while_full` failed with
`count moved on simultaneous rd+wr: 3`, expecting the FIFO to accept a write in
the same cycle a read drained a slot while full.

**Localization.** Read the RTL rather than the waveform: `wr_ready_o = !full_o`,
and `do_wr = wr_valid_i && wr_ready_o`. There is no path by which a concurrent
read can admit a write in the same cycle, and the module header says so
explicitly.

**Root cause.** The test, not the design. Admitting the write would require
`wr_ready_o = !full_o || do_rd`, which creates a combinational path from
`rd_ready_i` to `wr_ready_o` -- precisely the path a ready/valid cut exists to
break, and forbidden by hard constraint 3.

**Fix.** Rewrote the test to assert the real contract: while full, `wr_ready_o`
stays low even with a concurrent read; the write is accepted on the following
cycle; and no data is lost across the sequence. The behavioural cost is recorded
as decision D8, because the effective-occupancy number it implies is an input to
VC buffer sizing in Phase 3.

**Test that catches it now.**
`test_unit_fifo.py::test_full_refuses_write_even_with_concurrent_read`, which
now fails in the other direction -- if someone "optimizes" `wr_ready_o` to
depend on `rd_ready_i`, the test fails on the `refused` assertion.
